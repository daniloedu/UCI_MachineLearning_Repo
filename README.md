# UCI_MachineLearning_Repo
AWS ML Learning Exercise in Udacity

## Exercise: Refactoring â€“ Wine quality
In this exercise, I refactored code that analyzes a wine quality dataset taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Each row contains data on a wine sample, including several physicochemical properties gathered from tests, as well as a quality rating evaluated by wine experts.

You can check the work by downloading refactor_wine_quality.ipynb and the dataset winequality-red.csv. Open the notebook file using the Jupyter Notebook.
